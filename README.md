## How to install and run:
1) Download and install `Python` to your computer.

2) To install the project's dependencies, run command `pip install -r requirements.txt` (specify `pip2` or `pip3` if you have multiple versions of Python installed)

3) Download ZIP and extract

4) Modify example.py to your pleasing

5) Run program `python3 example.py` or `python example.py` on Mac, Linux or Windows

For example, see `example.py`. Just change the login and password information with your own, then run `example.py` and the bot will start doing it's magic!

#### 2) Set likes and unlike:
How many likes set bot in one day. The default value is 1000 likes per 24 hours.
If you want to do more than 1000 likes in a day - Instagram can ban you.
Usually, this bot is used 24/7 and it's default setup to distribute 1000 likes in day evenly. If you want more likes in one moment, set this parameter to 5000 or 10000 or more. Formula: set like with delay = `(24 hour * 60 minute * 60 second / like_per_day)`
###### Be careful, don't set more than 1000 like in a day or you can be banned! Be warned!!
```python
like_per_day=1000
```
Don't like media (photo or video) if it has more than `media_max_like` likes. `media_max_like = 0` will ignore this property. If media have too many likes - your like have not feedback.
Don't like media (photo or video) if it have less than `media_min_like` likes. `media_min_like = 0` will ignore this property.
```python
media_max_like=10
media_min_like=0
```
Tag list to like.
```python
tag_list = ['cat', 'car', 'dog']
```
List of list of words, each of which will be used to generate comment. For example: "This shot feels wow!"
```python
comment_list = [["this", "the", "your"], ["photo", "picture", "pic", "shot",
               "snapshot"], ["is", "looks", "feels", "is really"], ["great",
               "super", "good", "very good", "good","wow", "WOW", "cool",
               "GREAT","magnificent","magical", "very cool", "stylish",
               "beautiful","so beautiful", "so stylish","so professional",
               "lovely", "so lovely","very lovely", "glorious","so glorious",
               "very glorious", "adorable", "excellent","amazing"],
               [".", "..", "...", "!","!!","!!!"]]
```
If you don't want to generate comment, just random pick from list use:
```python
comment_list = [["WOW", "Amazing", "Cool", "So wonderful"]]
```
Like 1 to `max_like_for_one_tag` times by row.
```python
max_like_for_one_tag=5
```

You can like one tag:
```python
bot.get_media_id_by_tag('dog')
```
Like 4 times:
```python
bot.like_all_exist_media(4)
```
Or you can choose `auto_mod` (like all tags from setting by loop):
```python
bot.auto_mod()
```
For unlike:
```python
bot.unlike('media_id')
```
#### 3) Set comments:
```python
bot.comment('media_id', 'comment')
```
For example:
```python
bot.comment(11111111111111111111, 'Cool!')
```
#### 4) Follow and unfollow:
Follow:
```python
bot.follow('user_id')
```
Unfollow:
```python
bot.unfollow('user_id')
```
For example (follow and unfollow user with id 111111111):
```python
bot.follow(111111111)
bot.unfollow(111111111)
```
#### 5) Else:
Log mod: `log_mod=0` log to console, `log_mod=1` log to file, `log_mod=2` no log.
```python
log_mod = 0
```
unfollow_break_min / unfollow_break_max: These define the randomly selected amount of time in seconds that it will pause between unfollows on a break.
Example:
```
unfollow_break_min = 15
unfollow_break_max = 30
```
This will cause a delay of anywhere between 15 to 30 seconds between every unfollow.
#### 6) Logout from exist session:
```python
bot.logout()
```
## Usage examples
Standard use (will like by loop, all default tag):
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password')
bot.auto_mod()
```
Standard use with your tag (will like by loop, all your tag):
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password', tag_list = ['with', 'your', 'tag'])
bot.auto_mod()
```
Standard use with change default settings (you should know what you do!):
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password',
               like_in_day=100000,
               media_max_like=50,
               media_min_like=5,
               tag_list = ['like', 'follow', 'girls'],
               max_like_for_one_tag=50,
               log_mod = 1)
bot.auto_mod()
```
Get media_id buy one tag `'python'` and like 4 of them:
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password')
bot.get_media_id_by_tag('python')
bot.like_all_exist_media(4)
```

## Tested on:
Windows - Python 3.4 & Python 2.7.11

CentOS - Python 3.4 & Python 2.6

Ubuntu 15.10 wily - Python 3.4.3+ & 2.7.10

MacOS X El Captain 10.11.4 - Python 2.7
## Warning!
The End-User assumes sole responsibility for anything resulting from the use or modification this program.
Don't worry the bot will not:
- Like - comment or follow your own account or media
- Comment a media already commented

## Works with [InstagramAPI.py][4]
I rewrote, created by @mgp25 PHP class, to work with the Instagram API. This class gives ALL access to Instagram (login, post photo/video, comment, follow, get followers and etc.). This class pretends device on android and can work like android APP. In future, I will rewrite all this bot to InstagramAPI.py.

This class not ready for 100%, but I make most important things and you can work with it.
